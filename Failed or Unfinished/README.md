# Failed or Unfinished Projects

Welcome!  

This folder contains Python projects that I either didn’t finish or wasn’t fully happy with the result. These are more experimental in nature, and may contain bugs, incomplete features, or rough code. I’ve kept them here for reference, learning, or future improvements.  

Feel free to explore the folder to see how I experimented with different ideas and GUI layouts.  

## Current Projects
1. [GUI Calculator](https://github.com/Dennis-Wright/Dennis-Wright-Python-Projects/tree/main/Failed%20or%20Unfinished/GUI%20Calculator) 
   A basic calculator with a graphical interface. Functional but incomplete — some features and error handling are missing, and the UI layout could be improved.  

      

> **Note:** These projects are works-in-progress or experiments. I may revisit them in the future to improve features, code quality, or user interface.
