# Dennis Wright's Python Projects

Welcome!  

This repository contains a collection of Python projects I’ve created out of curiosity and for practice.  
They’re mostly simple, modular programs showcasing different programming concepts, including file handling, user authentication, and basic logic. 

Feel free to explore the folder structure to see how each project is organized.

1. 🔴 [GUI Calculator](https://github.com/Dennis-Wright/Dennis-Wright-Python-Projects/tree/main/Failed%20or%20Unfinished/GUI%20Calculator)  
   Basic GUI calculator using Tkinter. Haven’t tested thoroughly; I decided not to pursue the project further.  
   Main functions (Addition / Subtraction / Multiplication / Division) work with basic BODMAS logic.
