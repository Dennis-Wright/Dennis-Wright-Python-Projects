# Dennis Wright's Python Projects

Welcome!  

This repository contains a collection of Python projects I’ve created out of curiosity and for practice. They’re mostly simple, modular programs showcasing different programming concepts, including file handling, user authentication, and basic logic.  

Feel free to explore the folder structure to see how each project is organized.

1. [File Shredder](https://github.com/Dennis-Wright/Dennis-Wright-Python-Projects/tree/main/2026/The%20File%20Shredda)
   A simple command line app that shreds files by overwriting them with random data, renaming and then deleting. Can also do directories. Open its Readme for more in-depth information.
2. [Vault System](https://github.com/Dennis-Wright/Dennis-Wright-Python-Projects/tree/main/2026/Vault%20System)
   A simple command line app that stores your files in a vault for each user. Includes a login system, nice CLI layout, and uploading, deletion and copying files. Check the Readme!!

   A simple login system demonstrating password encryption and modular code using CSV files.

2. [Banking System](https://github.com/Dennis-Wright/Dennis-Wright-Python-Projects/tree/main/2025/Banking%20System)
   A basic banking application with login, withdraw, deposit, and balance check functionalities. Fully modular and CSV-based.

3. [Library System](https://github.com/Dennis-Wright/Dennis-Wright-Python-Projects/tree/main/2025/Library%20System)
   A library management system with user login, book borrowing/returning, and search features, all using CSV for storage.

## Failed/Unfinished Projects [^3]
[^3]: https://github.com/Dennis-Wright/Dennis-Wright-Python-Projects/tree/main/Failed%20or%20Unfinished
1. [GUI Calculator](https://github.com/Dennis-Wright/Dennis-Wright-Python-Projects/tree/main/Failed%20or%20Unfinished/GUI%20Calculator)
   Basic GUI Calculator using TKinter. Haven't tested, just didn't wan't to pursue the project further. Main functions (Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Divison) works with basic bodmas.
